## Hub vs Switch

Adress table: From mac Adress to physical port
The adress gets added when first connections is made (not a connection, a hub just forwards frames)

In a mac adress the last bit of the fist byte is used to identify a unicast or multicast


IPv6 multicast: ff02::1
IPv4 multicast: 224.0.0.1


Neighbor discover protocol is used in a switch to find the mac adress of the connected devices
